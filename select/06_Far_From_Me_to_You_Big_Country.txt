Somewhere there are orange trees
Somewhere skies are blue
Somewhere us a bridge across
The world from me to you
Sometimes in the darkest sky
Sun comes shining through
And tonight it seems so far from me to you

Yes tonight it seems so far from me to you

Some of us are safe alone
Some of us pretend
We can always start again
The things we'd never end

Some of us are born to fall
Others to stay true
But tonight it seem so far from me to you
Yes, tonight it seems so far from me to you

So tell me if you hear me come on
Tell me, tell me can you hear me come on
Now tell me if you hear me come on and tell me
I'm awake for you

And sometimes in the darkest hour
Love comes shining through
And it doesn't seem so far from me to you
No it doesn't seem so far from me to you

Listening in the darkness
To a voice I call my own
Shameful that my emptiness
Is turning me to stone

In the silence of the night
Love comes shining through
And it doesn't seem so far from me to you
No it doesn't seem so far from me to you

And deep into my darkest hour
Love comes shining through
And it doesn't seem so far from me to you
No it doesn't seem so far from me to you
